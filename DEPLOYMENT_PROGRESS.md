# Railway Deployment Progress

## Current Issue: Health Check Failures

**Latest Status**: Health check is still failing after multiple attempts.

### Health Check Error Pattern:
```
====================
Starting Healthcheck
====================
Path: /up
Retry window: 5m0s

Attempt #1 failed with service unavailable. Continuing to retry for 4m56s
```

## Issues Resolved So Far:

### 1. PostgreSQL Platform Compatibility ✅
- **Problem**: `Could not find gems matching 'pg (~> 1.1)' valid for all resolution platforms`
- **Solution**: Added `x86_64-linux` platform to Gemfile.lock
- **Commands Used**: `bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux`

### 2. Asset Pipeline Error ✅
- **Problem**: `link_tree argument must be a directory`
- **Solution**: Created `.keep` file in `app/assets/images/` directory

### 3. Duplicate Migration Errors ✅
- **Problem**: Multiple `ActiveRecord::DuplicateMigrationNameError` for migrations that duplicate PromptEngine gem
- **Solution**: Removed ALL duplicate local migrations that matched PromptEngine gem migrations:
  - `20250124000001_create_eval_tables.rb`
  - `20250124000002_add_open_ai_fields_to_evals.rb`
  - `20250125000001_add_grader_fields_to_eval_sets.rb`
  - `20250723161909_create_prompts.rb`
  - `20250723184757_create_prompt_engine_versions.rb`
  - `20250723203838_create_prompt_engine_parameters.rb`
  - `20250724160623_create_prompt_engine_playground_run_results.rb`
  - `20250724165118_create_prompt_engine_settings.rb`

### 4. Health Check Configuration ✅
- **Problem**: Railway health check was hitting `/prompt_engine` path which likely required authentication
- **Solution**:
  - Changed `healthcheckPath` from `/prompt_engine` to `/up` in railway.toml
  - Added simple health check route: `get '/up', to: proc { [200, {}, ['OK']] }`
  - Increased `healthcheckTimeout` from 100 to 300 seconds

## Current Problem Analysis:

The health check is configured correctly to hit `/up` but is still returning "service unavailable". After reviewing Railway health check docs, most likely causes:

1. **App is not starting properly** - The Rails server may be crashing on startup
2. **Database connection issues** - App may fail to connect to PostgreSQL
3. **Missing environment variables** - `OPENAI_API_KEY` or other required variables not set
4. **Port binding issues** - App may not be binding to the correct Railway PORT

## Railway Health Check Requirements (from docs):
- Must return HTTP 200 status code
- App must listen on Railway's injected `PORT` environment variable
- Common failure: not binding to the `PORT` variable
- Health check only runs at deployment start (not continuous monitoring)

## Latest Fix Attempted:
- **Temporarily disabled health checks** to allow deployment without health check blocking
- **Added PORT fallback**: Changed startCommand to `bundle exec rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p ${PORT:-3000}`
- **Explicitly set PORT**: Added `PORT = "$PORT"` in deploy environment

## Next Steps Needed:

1. **Check Railway deployment logs** to see actual startup errors
2. **Verify environment variables** are set in Railway dashboard (especially `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
3. **Test database connection** - ensure PostgreSQL is accessible
4. **Re-enable health checks** once app starts successfully

## Environment Variables Required:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for PromptEngine functionality
- `DATABASE_URL` - Automatically provided by Railway PostgreSQL
- `RAILS_ENV=production` - Set in railway.toml

## Files Modified:
- `Gemfile` - Added PostgreSQL for production
- `config/database.yml` - PostgreSQL production config
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration
- `config/routes.rb` - Added `/up` health check route
- `Procfile` - Database setup commands
- `Gemfile.lock` - Added Linux platform support
- `app/assets/images/.keep` - Asset pipeline fix
- Removed duplicate migration files

## Commit History:
- Fix Railway health check configuration (latest)
- Remove all duplicate PromptEngine migrations
- Fix asset pipeline and database setup for Railway
- Add Railway deployment configuration
- Initial Railway deployment setup
