# Complete Changes Summary - Ground Truth Redesign

## Executive Summary

Successfully redesigned the patent validity evaluation system to eliminate backend rules and enable direct JSON comparison between ground truth and LLM outputs.

## Files Modified

### 1. **app/services/ai/validity_analysis/service.rb**
**Changes:**
- Removed all `forced_value` method calls
- Removed mapping objects (SubjectMatter, InventiveConcept, ValidityScore)
- Return RAW LLM outputs directly
- Simplified overall_eligibility calculation to pure Alice Test logic

**Before:**
```ruby
subject_matter: subject_matter_obj.value,
inventive_concept: inventive_concept_obj.forced_value, # Forces :skipped if patentable!
validity_score: validity_score_obj.forced_value, # Forces 3 or 2 if inconsistent!
```

**After:**
```ruby
subject_matter: raw[:subject_matter],
inventive_concept: raw[:inventive_concept],
validity_score: raw[:validity_score],
overall_eligibility: calculated_from_alice_test_logic
```

### 2. **app/jobs/evaluation_job.rb**
**Changes:**
- Changed from string comparison to structured JSON comparison
- REMOVED validity_score from stored results
- Compare 3 fields: subject_matter, inventive_concept, overall_eligibility
- All fields must match for test to pass

**Before:**
```ruby
# Compared single field (overall_eligibility) as string
actual_output_for_grading = extract_result_for_grading(result)
passed = actual_normalized == expected_normalized
```

**After:**
```ruby
# Compare structured JSON with 3 fields
actual_output = {
  subject_matter: result[:subject_matter],
  inventive_concept: result[:inventive_concept],
  overall_eligibility: result[:overall_eligibility]
}
passed = all_three_fields_match?(actual, expected)
```

### 3. **app/controllers/prompt_engine/eval_sets_controller.rb**
**Changes:**
- Load from `gt_transformed_for_llm.csv` instead of old CSV
- NO value mapping needed (ground truth already matches schema)
- Include claim_text and abstract in ground truth data

**Before:**
```ruby
ground_truth_file = 'gt_aligned_normalized_test.csv'
# Complex mapping logic for inventive_concept
mapped_inventive_concept = case row['gt_inventive_concept']&.downcase
  when 'no ic found' then 'uninventive'
  # ...
end
```

**After:**
```ruby
ground_truth_file = 'gt_transformed_for_llm.csv'
# NO mapping - values already match!
ground_truth[key] = {
  subject_matter: row['gt_subject_matter'],
  inventive_concept: row['gt_inventive_concept'],
  overall_eligibility: row['gt_overall_eligibility']
}
```

### 4. **app/views/prompt_engine/eval_sets/metrics.html.erb**
**Changes:**
- REMOVED entire validity_score column
- Removed 50+ lines of validity score calculation logic
- Focus on 3 Alice Test fields only

**Before:**
```html
<th rowspan="2">Validity Score</th>
<!-- + 50 lines of score calculation logic -->
```

**After:**
```html
<!-- Validity score column REMOVED per architecture redesign -->
```

### 5. **progress.md**
**Changes:**
- Added complete architecture redesign documentation
- Documented all decisions and implementation plan
- Added 200+ lines of technical analysis

## New Files Created

### 1. **scripts/transform_new_ground_truth.rb**
- Transforms `Ground_truth.csv` to match LLM schema
- Maps Alice Test values to schema enums
- Output: `gt_transformed_for_llm.csv` (50 patents)

**Transformation rules:**
- "No IC Found" → "No"
- "IC Found" → "Yes"
- "N/A" → "-"
- "Not Abstract" → "Not Abstract/Not Natural Phenomenon"

### 2. **scripts/import_new_ground_truth.rb**
- Imports 50 patents into Railway database
- Creates TestCase records with full claim text and abstracts
- Expected output stored as JSON with 3 fields

### 3. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**
- Complete technical analysis
- File-by-file change documentation
- Risk mitigation strategies

### 4. **DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**
- Step-by-step Railway deployment guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Rollback plan

## Ground Truth Data

### Input: Ground_truth.csv
- **Source:** Client-provided file with 50 patents
- **Format:** CSV with columns: Patent Number, Claim #, Claim Text, Abstract, Alice Step One, Alice Step Two, Overall Eligibility
- **Size:** 50 patent claims with full text

### Output: gt_transformed_for_llm.csv
- **Format:** CSV matching LLM schema exactly
- **Columns:** patent_number, claim_number, claim_text, abstract, gt_subject_matter, gt_inventive_concept, gt_overall_eligibility
- **Values:** Transformed to match schema enums

**Distribution:**
- Subject Matter: 42 Abstract, 8 Not Abstract/Not Natural Phenomenon
- Inventive Concept: 35 No, 7 Yes, 8 -
- Overall Eligibility: 35 Ineligible, 15 Eligible

## Database Changes

### TestCase Records
**Before:**
- expected_output: Simple string (e.g., "ineligible")
- input_variables: Patent ID and claim number only

**After:**
- expected_output: JSON with 3 fields `{"subject_matter":"Abstract","inventive_concept":"No","overall_eligibility":"Ineligible"}`
- input_variables: Patent ID, claim number, FULL claim text, and abstract

### EvalResult Records
**Before:**
- actual_output: JSON with 4 fields (including validity_score)

**After:**
- actual_output: JSON with 3 fields only (NO validity_score)

## UI Changes

### Metrics Page
**Removed:**
- Validity Score column header
- Validity Score table cells
- 50+ lines of score calculation logic
- Score display styles (score-1, score-2, etc.)

**Kept:**
- Subject Matter column (Expected | Actual)
- Inventive Concept column (Expected | Actual)
- Overall Eligibility column (Expected | Actual)
- Pass/Fail indicators

## Testing Plan

### Local Testing (Completed)
✅ Transformed CSV successfully (50 records)
✅ Script runs without errors
✅ Value distribution verified
✅ All files committed to git

### Railway Testing (Pending)
⏳ Upload transformed CSV to Railway
⏳ Run import script
⏳ Create eval run with 2-3 patents
⏳ Verify JSON comparison works
⏳ Check UI displays correctly
⏳ Run full 50-patent evaluation

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] 50 test cases created in database
- [ ] Each test case has full claim_text and abstract
- [ ] Expected output is valid JSON with 3 fields
- [ ] Patent selection page shows 50 patents
- [ ] Evaluation runs without errors
- [ ] Metrics page shows 3 columns (NO validity_score)
- [ ] Pass/Fail logic compares all 3 fields
- [ ] Ground truth displays correctly
- [ ] LLM outputs are RAW (not forced)

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
⚠️ Old test cases incompatible with new system
⚠️ Old eval results use different format
⚠️ Ground truth CSV format changed

### Non-Breaking Changes
✅ System prompt unchanged
✅ LLM schema unchanged
✅ UI navigation unchanged
✅ Authentication unchanged

## Performance Impact

**Expected improvements:**
- ✅ Faster evaluation (no forced_value transformations)
- ✅ Simpler debugging (direct comparison)
- ✅ Fewer database queries (no score normalization)

**No negative impact expected:**
- LLM calls unchanged
- Database queries same count
- UI rendering same speed

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** (automatic via git push) ✅
2. **Upload CSV file** to Railway project ⏳
3. **Run import script** on Railway ⏳
4. **Test with 2-3 patents** to verify system ⏳
5. **Run full 50-patent evaluation** ⏳
6. **Analyze results** and iterate if needed ⏳
